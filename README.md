# activeFlotGen
Code generator for creating multiple interactive plots for viewing in the browser

## Purpose
To generate multiple web pages containing interactive plots.

## History
This code was created 7/10/2013 for the purpose of writing many web page files containing interactive Jquery- and Matlab- generated plots, as a supplement to a textbook.

## Installation
There is no actual installation

## Instructions
See DIRECTIONS.md

## Licence
See LICENCE.md

## Disclaimer
The purpose of making this code public, is to help beginning developers who are interested in creating browser-based interactive plots.  This code was used for a specific purpose, and would likely need to be modified on an individual basis.

Also, the Jquery/flot part of the plot generators worked very well.  The MATLAB part (running on a web server), never worked with the 'codes'.  However, I left in the MATLAB part of the code as is.  (The MATLAB codes needed were later programmed in C/javaScript on an individual basis, and these plots were also no longer interactive from the end-users point-of-view).
